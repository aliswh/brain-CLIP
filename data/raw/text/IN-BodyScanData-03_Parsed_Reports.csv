   In an operated case of epidermoid cyst of right CP angle, MR study
   reveals residual epidermoid cyst within right cerebello-pontine angle
   extending at right lateral aspect of pons superiorly and at right
   lateral aspect of medulla inferiorly.

   As compared to latest post operative CT report dated 10.06.2017, there
   appears to be increase in the size of redidual epidermoid cyst.

 A well defined large thick walled intraaxial cystic lesion showing thick ring-like enhancement on post contrast study noted in right parietal region with  disproportionate perilesional edema and mass effect as described above.  

Above features suggest neoplastic etiology possibly metastatic lesion in view of disproportionate perilesional edema, increased choline peak and increased choline/creatinine ratio.  .  

Possibility of infective etiology appears less likely.  

Suggested clinical correlation and further evaluation
